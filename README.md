# KillTheBugs
This project is a game named Kill The Bugs. It consists of a field of tiles on which different kinds of bugs can walk in a single direction only. Bugs are positioned on one side of the field and on the other side there are different kinds of groceries which the bugs can eat if they manage to get there.  The player's aim is to not let the bugs reach the groceries' side. To do this, there will be a set of weapons available to the player each having different prices and abilities to attack the bugs and there will be a character carrying some of these weapons. These weapons can be bought by the player and positioned in different tiles. Occasionally there will be money appearing in some random tiles that will disappear in a short amount of time and that the player has to collect before it disappears. The score system will be based on the number and types of bugs killed.
